# pmake

## Who its for:
		THIS UTILITY IS MAINLY MEANT TO BE USED IN COMBINATION WITH GNU EMACS.
		THIS UTILITY IS MAINLY MEANT FOR LINUX USERS, HOWEVER IT IS POSSIBLE TO GET IT TO WORK USING MSYS2 ON WINDOWS.
		THIS UTILITY IS MAINLY MEANT FOR GENERATING C PROJECT FOLDERS, BUT THE SOURCE CODE SHOULD BE EASY TO CONFIGURE FOR YOUR LANGUAGE OF CHOICE.
		THIS UTILITY HAS BIAS TOWARDS GCC, HOWEVER IT SHOULD BE EASY TO ALTER THE SOURCE CODE TO PREPARE THE MAKEFILE FOR THE COMPILER OF YOUR CHOICE.
## Soft dependencies:
		GNU C COMPILER (You can swap it for any C compiler in the source code by changing the CC variable in the printf function in S1. Alternatively, you could go for a different language entirely since gtags supports several other languages.)
		GNU EMACS (I havent really designed this script for other editors, but you are free to hack it for your own use case. I tried to document the code to make it easier.)

## Dependencies:
		GNU BASH (https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/)
		GNU MAKE (https://www.gnu.org/software/make/)
		GLOBAL (https://www.gnu.org/software/global/)
